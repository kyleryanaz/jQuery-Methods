            <p id="pTwo">I was sheriff of this county when I was twenty-five years 
                old. Hard to believe. Grandfather was a lawman. Father too. Me and 
                him was sheriff at the same time, him in Plano and me here. I think 
                he was pretty proud of that. I know I was. Some of the old-time 
                sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lot of folks find that hard to 
                believe.</p>
